QuizSoar aims to support students studying for the C191 and C857 objective assessments. It's built on the [React](https://reactjs.org) framework and stores statistics in [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) without a backend dependency. There are three types of questions: check box, radio button, and text field.
